<h3>Interest in IT</h3>
<p>My interest in the topic of IT as a whole started all the way back when I was a child just the website flash games on the pre-made computers from office works. Although I spend too much time on the computer, it sparked an interest in the generality of computers and how these machines operated, as years progressed, I've been surrounded by my sisters who constantly used technology one way or the other, exposing me to a lifestyle of technology, to the point that recently I've built my own computer. What I found fascinating initially was the idea of how computers operated, although, as years go by I've grown a much wider idea of the topic, now wondering how IT could help others with its present communicational capabilities and how it could be improved in the future for the younger generations to utilize devices much easier. </p>


<p>The main reason to why i chose RMIT of all the unis that serve the same course and skills, was the main driving fact that it’s in the city. I knew from the beginning that i wanted to experience different environments and meet people that i will never come across if i was back at my local uni, in hopes to make myself a more diverse person and enjoy my uni life to its maximum potential, ranging from the endless amount of hidden gemmed food stores and the scenic views melbourne has to offer. RMIT in my lens does not only serve an education that i desire but also opens gate ways to differences that i will most likely ever encounter, hence why RMIT is the chosen uni for me.</p>

<p>
What i expect to learn in this IT course is the skills and techniques to web administration , although i dont know exactly what im going to do in the future, web administration at the moment sounds most intriguing, and to further thrive in this profession, i will need to learn the foundation of programming languages, alongside the fundamentals of designing, developing, maintaining and troubleshooting websites. More importantly, i also hope to expand my communication skills for future purposes to network with other people for my line of work.
</p>
<h3>Ideal job</h3>
<p>The position i most likely want to be involved in this company is a website administrator, granting me the opportunity to control the company's website which I find very intriguing as it gives me a position of leadership and organization that I desire within a work environment.</p>

<p>The skills necessary for a web administrator is an exceptional ability to know multiple programming languages, for example, HTML, Java, XML, and CSS. Upon knowing multiple programming languages, you'll also have to know how to develop, design, maintain and troubleshoot websites. Qualifications to obtain such a role is to present a portfolio of past projects or anything related to web administration another qualification to this role is to have obtained a bachelor of computer science. In terms of experience, you would have to have prior projects related in terms of web development such as making websites for local businesses or creating a personal website utilizing the critical techniques to make an appealing website.</p>

<p>Currently do not have any sort of qualifications although I have skills and little to no experience in the position. The skills consist of being able to execute basic python programs and an understanding of website development. But in order to obtain this job, I thrive to finish my uni degree bachelor of information technology to then spend more time at university to then work my way to get my bachelor of computer science. Alongside studying for the degree will also do freelancing to obtain real-life experience and further broaden my portfolio. From then I will be able to have the necessary language to be eligible for the role.
Personal profile
</p>







<p>• These results highlight my personal attributes and where I am able to thrive within different situations, with this being said I’m able to pick and choose situations I would rather avoid and seek alternatives alongside situations I’m able to succeed. These results also assist in taking into account what type of people I’m willing to have worked beside me because if there are too many people similar or the same with my attributes then no new input will be able to be used.</p>

<p>These results may influence how I would be able to function within a certain environment, these also can dictate the efficiency that will be able to get done within a group setting. Some effects that may come out of this may be the result and how well put together it was due to the circumstances, which can vary from being productive or slacking therefore determining whether or not having the wrong influence may play a big factor in productivity.</p>

<p>When forming a team, what I take into consideration is the number of people that serve the same personalities if there are too many in one group then it may disrupt productivity. Another point that I would take into account is also the person’s demeanor in hopes to disable any sort of misinterpretations between peers as they may start to dislike one another creating a non-working environment.</p>

<h3>Project idea</h3>
<p>
The creation of advanced ai communication for the elderly is an innovative solution to make the elderly lives live peacefully without putting much energy into doing it themselves. This advance ai communication, will assist them with difficulties and disabilities they may have within their daily lives. What consists of this ai is a camera that monitors the wellbeing of the elderly if they are unable to help themselves and on the chance that they are in danger the ai will be able to call assistance immediately, it will also output sounds and have inputted sounds that can transfer to different devices eg, the phone, home speakers or smartwatch.
</p>

<p>Age is inevitable and with time and patience we lose our abilities to things that were once normal, and that’s just the way of life. From a certain point in life, we are destined to disconnect from modern society as we are unable to grasp the speed of progression at such an old age. Additionally when the time comes our body parts that once functioned normally will now feel confined or rigid which hinders the elderly livelihoods but through the implementation of advanced ai communication in the elderly daily lives, then they are able to access and continue their errands or needs more simply in comparison to physically going.</p>

<p>To help the elderly retain their normal lives without a problem due to their instability, the solution of advanced AI communication comes in place to assist minor inconveniences that occur daily but that doesn’t stop there, with this advanced system it is able to tell whether or not the user is in need of help from medical expertise, with no real human monitoring through from the camera, the AI is able to judge whether or not the person is suffering or not. The help that the AI can range from minor experiences such as needing to call someone, helping to buy groceries, helping to call someone all the way to extreme situations like calling the ambulance or calling the next-door neighbor for the necessary medicine. But with something great, comes with major obstacles that cannot be avoided, which is teaching the elderly how to interact with the technology as there are some specific features that the AI needs to be said before commencing the task. For example, if the user wanted to access the AI on their device they would have to touch their screen simultaneously twice before popping up, then before saying the user wants, they will also have to say the name of the AI and then tell their command. Another feature that this AI has is to be able to identify if the user is in need of help from the camera that’s installed around their house.
Before the user uses the AI, the AI has to have a general idea of what the users face is, in order to do so the user will be in front of the camera for a minute for the 2D and 3D sensors to capture the face to then transform it into digital data by applying an algorithm before comparing the image capture to those held in a database. The advanced AI communication is able to recognize where the user is in need of help or not is through facial recognition. This facial recognition utilizes a convolutional neural network as the images are annotated with the right data labeling techniques to produce high-quality training datasets to detect a variety of faces that the user may have when in the situation of emergency. Alongside facial recognition, the camera has a fitted sound system on the occasion that the user is hurt or is in grave danger and begins to shout or scream, which then has a high level of intensity of the sound that will instantly trigger a call to the nearest hospital. The AI will also have the users preset the necessary information to tell to the person on the other end. For example, the AI will say the following, “This is an emergency, the house owner is Margret Moore, 63 choc chip dr.” and if the text speech was too fast, the person is able to replay the message.
</p>

<p>The main tool needed is a computer for the software to run smoothly, alongside the necessary peripherals to work and multiple cameras so that the AI is able to identify. The software required for this to happen is ‘Amazon Rekognition’ as it is used to engage in facial analysis, face search for verification, and identify people and objects by labeling them. The reason why this is being used is that this tool is able to recognize more than 100 people in a single image due to Amazon’s pre-existing datasets at its disposal allowing AI and ML algorithms to learn and more accurately identify the faces.</p>

<p>The necessary skills are knowing how to execute programs in different languages such as python or C++, knowledge of deep learning skills, camera engineers, and UI developers. In order to create the AI, we will have to use external sources such as ‘Amazon Rekognition’ as it has a ‘free tier’ which will grant us access without any funds being used. The ability to find the required people may not be easy to find, making it not feasible to carry out this operation, as it is a fundamental requirement to have an expert programmer in order to operate the AI, although the software to commence the operation is very accessible to the public.</p>

<p>If this project was to succeed then the wellbeing and comfortability of the elderly will be more secure than it already is, the elderly will be able to continue their daily needs without inconveniences as the AI will be that middle man to connect the user to the phone or to their desires. If the AI was able to successfully help the elderly be in contact with the hospital quicker then the caretakers of the elderly are able to help at the hospital. Keeping account of the current pandemic that’s going on, the hospitals will have more hands for people who are in critical condition.</p>
